The Employee is just a common place for common properties
separate tables are created for each entity (subclass). It is as say that there is no real hiearchical relationship between subclasses
STRUCTURE

create table full_time_employee (
       id bigint not null,
        name varchar(255) not null,
        salary decimal(19,2),

INSERTION

insert 
    into
        full_time_employee
        (name, salary, id) 
    values
        (?, ?, ?)


RETRIEVE (two separate queries on both tables)

select
        parttimeem0_.id as id1_2_,
        parttimeem0_.name as name2_2_,
        parttimeem0_.hourly_wage as hourly_w3_2_ 
    from
        part_time_employee parttimeem0_

PROS
- No inheritance is represented in the database, entities are totally separated
(can be an advantage if the application requires this feature)

CONS
-  We cannot query using the superclass beacuse it is not an entity we can use to 
query instances

PROS
- semplicity and performance

CONS
- data integrity is not well represented because it is only due to nullable (and null values) in the table 
 It's easy to break data integrity (use JOINED method if data integrity is relevant)
- if the hierarchy is large and variable, the single table will be very large

- common columns are repeated (if they are many the repetition will be a lot of reduncancy)

- better data structure

CONS
- data retrieval requires a JOIN (even multiple if the query is on the parent class) that could be a performance issue
